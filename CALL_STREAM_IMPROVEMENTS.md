# SignalRadio Live Call Stream Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Unified Data Models (DTOs)
- Created `CallDto`, `TalkGroupDto`, `RecordingDto`, `TranscriptionDto` in both TypeScript and C#
- These DTOs ensure consistent data format between API and SignalR Hub

### 2. API Controller Updates
- Updated `CallsController` to return DTO format instead of raw entities
- Added TalkGroup information in API responses (previously missing)
- Included transcriptions in call data

### 3. SignalR Hub Improvements  
- Updated `HubCallNotifier` to send the same DTO format as API
- Eliminated data format discrepancies between API and Hub messages
- Added proper URL construction for recording links

### 4. WebClient Simplification
- Completely rewrote `CallStream.tsx` to eliminate complex fallback logic
- Removed excessive property name variations and caching mechanisms
- Simplified to expect consistent DTO format from both API and Hub
- Updated `CallCard.tsx` to work with new DTO structure

### 5. Enhanced Data Loading
- API now includes TalkGroup data in all call responses
- Eliminated need for separate TalkGroup lookups in the client
- Added proper transcription data handling

## Benefits

1. **Data Consistency**: API and Hub now return identical data structures
2. **Simplified Client Code**: Removed ~100 lines of complex fallback logic
3. **Better Performance**: No more individual TalkGroup API calls from client
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for data models
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout

## Key Files Changed

- `/src/SignalRadio.Api/Dtos/CallDtos.cs` - New DTO definitions
- `/src/SignalRadio.Api/Extensions/EntityExtensions.cs` - Entity to DTO conversion
- `/src/SignalRadio.Api/Controllers/CallsController.cs` - Return DTOs
- `/src/SignalRadio.Api/Services/HubCallNotifier.cs` - Send DTOs via SignalR  
- `/src/SignalRadio.WebClient/src/types/dtos.ts` - TypeScript DTO definitions
- `/src/SignalRadio.WebClient/src/pages/CallStream.tsx` - Simplified client logic
- `/src/SignalRadio.WebClient/src/components/CallCard.tsx` - Updated for DTOs

## Next Steps

The live call stream now has a much cleaner, more maintainable implementation. Both the API and SignalR Hub send the same consistent data format, and the WebClient expects and handles this single format without complex fallback logic.
